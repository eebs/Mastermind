					"is added, and the computer picks 5 colors instead of 4.\n\nAfter each guess, the computer will give you a certain number " +
					"of white and black pegs.\nThe number of white pegs indicates how many colors you've guessed correctly that AREN'T in the right " +
					"spot.\nThe number of black pegs indicates how many colors you've guessed correctly that ARE in the right spot.\nFor example, " +
					"say the correct answer is 'R B Y Y' and you just guessed 'R O O B', you will be given the message (1W, 1B).\nThis means you " +
